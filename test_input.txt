Standard Operating Procedure: Information Management and Quality Improvement

1. CONFIDENTIALITY AND ACCESS CONTROL

This hospital maintains strict confidentiality of all patient information and ensures privacy of records
at all times. All medical records are stored securely with authorized access granted only to designated
clinical and administrative staff. The hospital enforces role based access control through its Health
Information Management System (HIMS). Restricted access is enforced via biometric and credential-based
authentication. Data security measures include firewall protection and encryption. Physical security
of paper-based records is maintained through locked storage areas. All electronic medical records are
backed up daily. Password protection is enabled on all systems handling patient data.

2. RECORD RETENTION AND DESTRUCTION

The hospital defines a retention period of 5 years for outpatient records and 10 years for inpatient
records. The record retention policy is reviewed annually and approved by the Medical Records Committee.
Duration of storage is clearly documented for each record type. Upon expiry, record destruction is
carried out through secure shredding and certified data disposal processes. Secure destruction logs
are maintained for audit purposes.

3. QUALITY MONITORING

The hospital identifies quality indicators for all clinical departments. Monitoring is conducted monthly
through data collection of clinical and operational metrics. Measurement outcomes are tracked and
reported. Quarterly analysis and review of indicator performance is carried out. Evaluation of trends
is documented. Where deviations are found, corrective action plans are developed and tracked. Preventive
action mechanisms are established to avoid recurrence.

4. HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

The hospital maintains a job description for every staff category clearly defining roles and
responsibilities of staff. Employee records are maintained in individual staff files containing personal
details, qualification documents, and employment history. Leave records are tracked through HRMS. A
formal grievance redressal mechanism is in place for all employees. Disciplinary procedures follow a
documented policy. Complaint handling is managed through a committee structure.
